# ADB-Purifier
A script that connects to Anrdoid Debug Bridges in the wild and removes a common crypto malware

# Requirements 
This is a bash script, it needs shodan and android debug tools installed, beyond that, patience, if you have no errors, it's running. Trust CLI!

Run start.sh to get a nice result log at the end with shiny numbers and the whole yard, or just run the engine directly, either way, doesn't matter to me.

Deleting this file isn't necessary, just don't.


# Let it run till the end, do not run it too often
Few tweaks can be made to add an apk to install and run (This can be something malicious) or you can use it to acquire a large list
of ip addresses and do a coordinated DDOS attack using nothing but ADB commands.
